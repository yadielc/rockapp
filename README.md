<strong>Rock App: Rock Appreciation Society Website</strong>

A simple single page ReactJs application. This application was part of the "React Essential Training Course" on Lynda.com by Eve Porcello. The application uses React Router to navigate between the different pages of the website.

Also, we used the randomuser API to access user data for the members component.
